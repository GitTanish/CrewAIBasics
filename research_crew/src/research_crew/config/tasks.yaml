  description: >
    Research and generate a comprehensive report on {topic}.
    Use current information from {current_year}. Prioritize credible, primary sources.
    Target length: approximately 2000 words. Focus on depth over breadth.
  expected_output: >
    A structured research report in markdown (no code fences) with these sections:

    1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (150-200 words): Key findings and takeaways upfront. A busy reader should understand the core message from this alone.

    2. BACKGROUND (200-300 words): Context needed to understand the topic. Define key terms. Explain why this matters now.

    3. FINDINGS (800-1000 words): The substantive research, organized by theme or importance. Each major point should cite its source. Present competing perspectives where they exist.

    4. ANALYSIS (300-400 words): Your interpretation of the findings. What patterns emerge? What are the implications? Distinguish between established facts and your inferences.

    5. RECOMMENDATIONS (150-200 words): Actionable next steps or conclusions based on the analysis.
    
    6. SOURCES: List all referenced sources with enough detail to locate them.

    Quality criteria: Flag any low-confidence claims. Acknowledge knowledge gaps explicitly rather than glossing over them.

blog_task:
  description: >
    Create an engaging blog post on {topic} that educates and entertains.
    Research the most relevant, current information. Write for curious readers who are new to intermediate on the subject.
    Target length: 800-1200 words. Prioritize clarity and engagement over comprehensiveness.
  expected_output: >
    A reader-friendly blog post in markdown (no code fences) with:

    OPENING HOOK (1-2 paragraphs): Start with a compelling question, surprising fact, or relatable scenario that answers "why should I care?"

    BODY (3-5 sections with clear headings): Break complex ideas into digestible chunks. Use:
    - Short paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)
    - Bullet points for lists
    - Real-world examples or analogies to explain technical concepts
    - Conversational tone—write like explaining to a smart friend

    CLOSING (1 paragraph): Memorable takeaway or call-to-action. Leave the reader with something to think about or do.

    Quality criteria: Every paragraph should earn its place—no filler. Cite sources for factual claims. If something is your opinion vs. established fact, make that clear.
